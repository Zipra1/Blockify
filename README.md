# Blockify
An ad blocking program for Spotify on Windows 10. It's a little iffy, but it works. Mostly just a project for me to practice coding on.
To update your current version of Blockify, uninstall the old one from Add or Remove Programs. Then, unzip this version somewhere and it should work as intended.
