# Blockify
An ad blocking program for Spotify on Windows 10. It's a little iffy, but it works. Mostly just a project for me to practice coding on.
If you're here to update your version, download the zip file, called something along the lines of "1.0.0.9"
To update your current version of Blockify, uninstall the old one from Add or Remove Programs. Then, unzip this version somewhere and it should work as intended.

Known problems:
  Minimizing fullscreen apps
  Stealing focus for a second, this is not too big a deal on windowed apps.
  Causes some fullscreen apps to repeatedly open and close.
